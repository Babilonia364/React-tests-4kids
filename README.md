# I'VE ONLY MADE THE TESTS OF THIS PROJECT. NOT THE BACKEND NOR THE SPA, ONLY TESTS
# Alura's course React Tests
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I made this project to strengthen my knowlege about react tests in general.

### Here a i use tests to avoid changes on code breaking differente components

## Just use yarn start after yarn install (or npm, i'm not your dad)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn backend`

Runs the backend on [http://localhost:3001]
